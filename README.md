# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-R

I have developed a R script for my 'Data Mining for Business' class at Harvard University. The diamond dataset which we used consists of 60,000 records and 10 variables. To better understand the data, I started exploring the data set by using different built in functions of R. I analyzed the data by performing summary statistics and understanding each variable in the data frame. For visualizing the data, I created multiple bar plots and maps of different regions in USA.

Library Used: maps, ggplot2, ggthemes, mapproj
